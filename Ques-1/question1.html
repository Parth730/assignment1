	<div><h2><i><u>What is mutual </u></i></h2>
		<p><b><marquee>A mutual fund is an investment vehicle where many investors pool their money to earn returns on their capital over a period. This corpus of funds is managed by an investment professional known as a fund manager or portfolio manager. It is his/her job to invest the corpus in different securities such as bonds, stocks, gold and other assets and seek to provide potential returns. The gains (or losses) on the investment are shared collectively by the investors in proportion to their contribution to the fund.</marquee></p>
	</div>
	<div><h2><i><u>What is NAV?</u></i></h2>
		<p><b>The performance of a particular scheme of a Mutual Fund is denoted by Net Asset Value (NAV).</b><br>In simple words, NAV is the market value of the securities held by the scheme. Mutual Funds invest the money collected from investors in securities markets. Since market value of securities changes every day, NAV of a scheme also varies on day to day basis.</p></div>
		<blink>The NAV per unit is the market value of securities of a scheme divided by the total number of units of the scheme on any particular date.</blink>
